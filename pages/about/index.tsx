        <p>
          We love photography and photogrammetry. Bluntly and deeply. This very pole enables us to build and propel the
          future of meta, digital, and traditional media.
        </p>
        <p>
          LTL&apos;s proposal is simple yet not easy to implement and succeed: photography and photogrammetry-centric
          community NFT platform with a curated collection from award-winning and relevant photographers. In short,
          aiming for quality over quantity both for the art and the community. A place where creators and the community
          can have an open conversation, cruise the markets, and enjoy life-changing experiences. A way to improve
          artists&apos; lives and nourish the sensibilities of all art lovers. Our mission is to use treasury funding to
          work with artists and commission them to do exclusive mints under the LTL Mint Pass. The goal is as much
          financial as it is about living life. We want to express a feeling of community where people who love food,
          wine, art, and tech come together. Resident artist Dimitri Daniloff has bestowed us with his artwork to
          support the movement. LiveTheLifeTV will curate upcoming artists to join the initiative. The LTL brand needs
          to be bold, powerful, full of style, and express freedom. This is just the genesis, those with our Values will
          always feel at HOHM with us.
        </p>

          The platform covers almost all the steps having the artists fully guided and supported to create NFTs matching
          the high quality of their original physical artworks on custom smart contracts. Easily, art galleries can be
          set up to display on the website, in the metaverse, or even in the tangible reality of their art pieces. The
          auction house is the opportunity for photography and photogrammetry collectors and lovers to support the
          artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each month will be dedicated to an artist whose artworks will be revealed at auction on daily basis and
          accessible to LTL Mint Pass hodlers. The first artist kicking it all off will be Dimitri Daniloff with the
          astounding DDA collection as full unfolding into the NFT world. &nbsp;Backed with the DDA Creator Contract,
          authenticity and provenance are ensured while carbon offsetting using Klima is in place. Right upon the
          minting, the on-chain redemption process will be available allowing for instance the collectors to verify the
          ownership and request a Master Print, or a Digital NFT TV.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Founders Mint Pass is in a superstate where it constantly fluctuates between art, proof of ownership,
          access keys, items (physical and digital), and perceived values.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of memberships (LTL Mint Pass) allows community development and supports the work of devs, designers,
          and visual storytellers. There only will be 1000 members who will benefit from curational power, first in line
          to IRL and digital experiences, early access to our NFT-based membership mint, digital drops, and quite some
          more surprises yet to be disclosed. &nbsp;These NFTs will act as membership proof while treasuring high
          artistic value. What makes NFTs truly interesting is not the speculative nature of these assets, but the
          ability to create derivative works off of these assets transforming them to become productive assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone who contributes scarce time and attention to our venture should receive pro-rata rewards for
          producing and curating high-quality code, design, and content. As we lean into building deeper relationships
          with participants and stakeholders, we&apos;re looking to do this using programmable equity. With customized
          rights and restrictions, we can expand the definition of employee equity to include anyone who helps drive our
          business as on our team - customers, business partners, community members, etc..
        </p>
        <p>
          The path chosen to initiate and boost our shared appreciation and arousal of these masterpieces to the
          community has been a free mint of a genuine artwork of Dimitry Daniloff. A nice invitation gift for starters.{' '}
