# Frontend Instructions

Use this guide for frontend work in the project.

It uses Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Radix UI, and Framer Motion.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy. Write everything that is needed.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever the user asks for.

## Steps

Let's replace the main button with a more stunning one

## Reminders

- We use the Next.js 14 app router
- Try and group components into folders
- TypeScript 5.0.4 or higher
- All new components should go in `/modules` , always create a folder and use index.ts to export and name the actual component `example-component.tsx`
- All new pages go in `pages` , always create a folder and name the file index.tsx

## Requirements

- All data fetching should be done in a server component and pass the data down as props
- Client components (useState, hooks, etc) require that 'use client' is set at the top of the file
- useRouter should be imported from next/navigation
